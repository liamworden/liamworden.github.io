              This was probably my favorite vacation I've ever been on. I'm sorry to my family for saying that,
              but this was also the only vacation I've been on with a group of 12 of my friends, plus Mr. Hirschhorn and
              Ms. Keniston. I will include below the journal entry for the Monday of that trip, written by myself and Greta.
              This was probably my favorite day of the trip, and other people on the trip have said that this is in
              the running for top five days of their life so far. I also will include any pictures that feature myself
              or one of either Brother Hirschhorn or Sister Keniston.

            <p>
              Due to the late night yesterday, we didn’t have time to write the journal. So today we’re writing for today and yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yesterday we had a bright and early start, eating breakfast at 6 and packing lunch before departing at 6:30 for our Disneyland
              adventure. We were treated to many fun facts about the place where dreams come true by Mr. Hirschhorn on the drive over. We parked
              and walked towards the gates with many yelps of joy from a skipping, mickey-mouse ear wearing Mr. Hirschhorn.

            <p>
              Upon entering the gates we raced toward the first ride we could find that was open: the Haunted Mansion. We were treated to a
              most terrifying experience at 8:15 AM, riding down a dark, nightmare before Christmas-themed track. Afterwards, we split into
              smaller groups. Agreeing to meet at 11:30 for Mr. Hirschhorn’s favorite ride, the Jungle Cruise. Some of us went to Thunder Mountain,
               and others went to Star Tours and then on to Space Mountain. Star Tours was a room where they gave you 3D glasses and they shook the
               room to make you feel like you were on a spaceship. Then one group went to Star Wars: Millennium Falcon. It was a simulation of a
               spaceship where you could steer and shoot down other ships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then we all met Mr. Hirschhorn and Ms. Keniston outside the Jungle Cruise. We got Pineapple Dole Whip and placed our orders for dinner.
               The Jungle Cruise was a boat that went down a river with hippos, crocodiles, elephants, monkeys and tigers. A skipper steered the boat
               and told jokes.

            <p>
              After the Jungle Cruise a large group went to Earl of Sandwich for some frozen lemonade, sandwiches and shopping in the World of Disney
               store. There were two large parades throughout the day, featuring Moana and Maui and many people dancing and singing. Some of us went
               to the Peter Pan ride and Tomorrowland, while others went to Pirates of the Caribbean, which had a very impressive indoor, nighttime-like
               atmosphere experienced by boat. We rode down a river surrounded by pirates and heaping mounds of treasure. A large group then went to
               Buzz Lightyear which was a ride during which we shot down aliens with laser guns. The next ride was the Matterhorn which was a very
               thrilling roller coaster through a mountain with a yeti inside. Some of us then went onto the spinning teacups and the carousel.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this we met for dinner at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge. Dinner consisted of "moof juice" and some delicious salads and "braised bantha."
               We then continued our 15-hour day, with some going to the Star Wars Millennium Falcon ride and others going to the Star Wars Rise of the
               Resistance. It was a really impressive attraction. We were treated as real life Star Wars hostages and had to escape from stormtroopers
               and Kylo Ren in multiple ships. We then decided to experience Big Thunder Mountain again but at night this time, featuring bats and
               glowing stalactites and stalagmites. It was nothing short of thrilling. We moved onto the Jungle Cruise for a second time, while others
               watched the firework projection display on the castle. The very last ride we went on was Space Mountain, an indoor roller coaster in the
               dark surrounded by thousands of stars. We met at the main gates and made our way back to the vans after an extremely fun but tiring day.

            <p>
              Greta’s Apple Watch supplied that we walked 13 miles, almost a half marathon throughout the entire day.
